/*
 * problem.cpp - Solution Implementation
 * 
 * WHAT TO EDIT:
 * - Everything between BEGIN_SOLUTION and END_SOLUTION markers
 * - Add any includes you need at the top (they will auto-extract to submit.cpp)
 * - Implement solution() function with your algorithm
 * - Add helper functions if needed (between the markers)
 * 
 * WHAT NOT TO EDIT:
 * - The BEGIN_SOLUTION and END_SOLUTION comment markers (critical for extraction)
 * - Don't add main() here - it's in submit_template.cpp
 * - Don't include "problem.h" inside the markers
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * - Code between markers gets extracted to submit.cpp by make command
 * - All #include statements (except problem.h) are auto-extracted
 * - This keeps your solution clean and HackerRank-ready
 * 
 * EXAMPLE PATTERNS:
 * 
 * Pattern 1: Read input, process, print output
 *   void solution() {
 *       int n;
 *       cin >> n;
 *       cout << n * 2 << endl;
 *   }
 * 
 * Pattern 2: Return a value (main() will handle I/O)
 *   int solution(int n) {
 *       return n * 2;
 *   }
 * 
 * Pattern 3: With helper functions
 *   int helper(int x) { return x * 2; }
 *   void solution() {
 *       int n;
 *       cin >> n;
 *       cout << helper(n) << endl;
 *   }
